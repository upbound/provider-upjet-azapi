                      - **List**: A list of paths that need to be exported from the response body. Setting it to `["*"]` will export the full response body. Here's an example. If it sets to `["properties.loginServer", "properties.policies.quarantinePolicy.status"]`, it will set the following HCL object to the computed property output.

                      - **Map**: A map where the key is the name for the result and the value is a JMESPath query string to filter the response. Here's an example. If it sets to `{"login_server": "properties.loginServer", "quarantine_status": "properties.policies.quarantinePolicy.status"}`, it will set the following HCL object to the computed property output.

                      The attribute can accept either a list or a map.

                      - **List**: A list of paths that need to be exported from the response body. Setting it to `["*"]` will export the full response body. Here's an example. If it sets to `["properties.loginServer", "properties.policies.quarantinePolicy.status"]`, it will set the following HCL object to the computed property output.

                      ```text
                      {
                      properties = {
                      loginServer = "registry1.azurecr.io"
                      policies = {
                      quarantinePolicy = {
                      status = "disabled"
                      }
                      }
                      }
                      }
                      ```

                      - **Map**: A map where the key is the name for the result and the value is a JMESPath query string to filter the response. Here's an example. If it sets to `{"login_server": "properties.loginServer", "quarantine_status": "properties.policies.quarantinePolicy.status"}`, it will set the following HCL object to the computed property output.

                      ```text
                      {
                      "login_server" = "registry1.azurecr.io"
                      "quarantine_status" = "disabled"
                      }
                      ```
