            body: (Dynamic) A dynamic attribute that contains the request body.
            create: (String) A string that can be parsed as a duration consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
            create_headers: (Map of String) A mapping of headers to be sent with the create request.
            create_query_parameters: (Map of List of String) A mapping of query parameters to be sent with the create request.
            delete: (String) A string that can be parsed as a duration consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
            delete_headers: (Map of String) A mapping of headers to be sent with the delete request.
            delete_query_parameters: (Map of List of String) A mapping of query parameters to be sent with the delete request.
            error_message_regex: (List of String) A list of regular expressions to match against error messages. If any of the regular expressions match, the error is considered retryable.
            id: (String) The ID of the Azure resource.
            ignore_casing: (Boolean) A dynamic attribute that contains the request body.
            ignore_missing_property: (Boolean) Whether ignore not returned properties like credentials in body to suppress plan-diff. Defaults to true. It's recommend to enable this option when some sensitive properties are not returned in response body, instead of setting them in lifecycle.ignore_changes because it will make the sensitive fields unable to update.
            interval_seconds: (Number) The base number of seconds to wait between retries. Default is 10.
            locks: (List of String) A list of ARM resource IDs which are used to avoid create/modify/delete azapi resources at the same time.
            max_interval_seconds: (Number) The maximum number of seconds to wait between retries. Default is 180.
            multiplier: (Number) The multiplier to apply to the interval between retries. Default is 1.5.
            name: (String) Specifies the name of the Azure resource. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
            output: (Dynamic) The output HCL object containing the properties specified in response_export_values. Here are some examples to use the values.
            parent_id: (String) The ID of the azure resource in which this resource is created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
            randomization_factor: '(Number) The randomization factor to apply to the interval between retries. The formula for the randomized interval is: RetryInterval * (random value in range [1 - RandomizationFactor, 1 + RandomizationFactor]). Therefore set to zero 0.0 for no randomization. Default is 0.5.'
            read: (String) A string that can be parsed as a duration consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
            read_headers: (Map of String) A mapping of headers to be sent with the read request.
            read_query_parameters: (Map of List of String) A mapping of query parameters to be sent with the read request.
            replace_triggers_external_values: |-
                (Dynamic) Will trigger a replace of the resource when the value changes and is not null. This can be used by practitioners to force a replace of the resource when certain values change, e.g. changing the SKU of a virtual machine based on the value of variables or locals. The value is a dynamic, so practitioners can compose the input however they wish. For a "break glass" set the value to null to prevent the plan modifier taking effect.
                If you have null values that you do want to be tracked as affecting the resource replacement, include these inside an object.
                Advanced use cases are possible and resource replacement can be triggered by values external to the resource, for example when a dependent resource changes.
            replace_triggers_refs: (List of String) A list of paths in the current Terraform configuration. When the values at these paths change, the resource will be replaced.
            response_export_values: (Dynamic) The attribute can accept either a list or a map.
            retry: '(Attributes) The retry block supports the following arguments: (see below for nested schema)'
            timeouts: (Block, Optional) (see below for nested schema)
            type: (String) In a format like <resource-type>@<api-version>. <resource-type> is the Azure resource type, for example, Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts. <api-version> is version of the API used to manage this azure resource.
            update: (String) A string that can be parsed as a duration consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
            update_headers: (Map of String) A mapping of headers to be sent with the update request.
            update_query_parameters: (Map of List of String) A mapping of query parameters to be sent with the update request.
